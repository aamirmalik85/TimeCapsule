# Time Capsule Generator

## Overview

The **Time Capsule Generator** is a web application built using **Streamlit** and powered by **OpenAI's GPT-3.5/4** model. It allows users to create personalized time capsules by reflecting on their current life, goals, and thoughts. The application generates a unique time capsule containing a reflective summary, future predictions, and a heartfelt letter from the user's past self to their future self. Users can also share their time capsules on social media or download them as JSON files.
